      <p class='project-description'>This was my two-week final project I made at Makers Academy. The idea of the game is to introduce children to two basic concepts of programming: state and behaviour. Players can alter the state of the game (including the colour of the playing board and the layout of the emojis) as well as the behaviour of the character through a series of programmed instructions.</p>

      <p class='project-description'>This is a simple app, built in Express. A user can submit a transaction request, and the details of their device (such as browser and location) are sent to the server, and a random http response is simulated.</p>

      <p class='project-description'>I built a fully-reponsive modal as an additional feature to an app that was built in React and Redux. I worked on another developer's code base and managed to integrate my code to fit the design of the code and styling of the application.</p>
